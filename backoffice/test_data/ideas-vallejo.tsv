185343	14 year old VOTERS?	As much as these teens are an important asset to the community, I question their cognitive skills to make independent choices based on logic and reason.  In the past with this Measure, the clubs and youth groups stuffed the ballots in favor of projects deemed important by leaders.       It may be better to have funds broken down by percents for groups to ALL benefit:  Youth 25%  Seniors 25% general public 25%  Open 25%    P.S.  what about lost funds from income on the Vallejo Muni Marina ???

Include any tax incentives for the employer support.  Parents whose home naturally become the neighborhood kid magnet could be very beneficial as part of the resource officer support because they bring with them a rapport with a group of students.  Parents who are part of Vallejo's youth sports community have established relationships with many athletes and first hand knowledge of their temperaments that would also prove beneficial in promoting respectful, happy students.  I think parents patrolling the campus would bring a balance to the presence of law enforcement.  It has become necessary to have law enforcement present on our school grounds, but too much can create an atmosphere similar to the correctional officer guarding  prisoners on the yard and in turn students on the defense.  A parent safety squad would make it affordable for the district to implement while engaging the parent.

172273	Student Support for Social & Emotional Needs 	Students currently attending VCUSD schools have no Counselors in place to help support them through severe social-emotional needs. Our youth of Vallejo are in desperate need of the support that Counselors offer and the value they can add to the educational system overall. As a former VCUSD student, it was imperative that we were provided Counselors. While a student, I was helped: educationally, socially and emotionally, by very influential Counselors from within our community. The Counselors would also follow students throughout our whole middle and high school careers. Relationships were built and trust was established over years of interactions. Our youth today need even more access to properly trained adults that are in place to simply listen and mentor them on a consistent basis. Full Service Community Schools can not be successful without the reimplementation of full time Counselors in middle schools and high schools.

187272	Drivers Education at High Schools	     With teens on the road nowadays, its only fair that they get some practice in some sort of program that is free. This will help students get the hang of driving much faster and will have them ready to take their test at the D.M.V. Drivers ed in high schools is becoming less common, it kind of sucks how some teens are forced to go to the D.M.V. to take their driving lessons now. The bad thing about this is that if they were to fail, they have to wait 2 weeks to take it again.       Parents are also effected by this since now they have to teach their children how to drive with the risk of damage to their car. Re-adding this drivers ed program can help out teens and their parents, this could also prevent crashes and accidents since teens will have had better practice driving with the program than they would with their parents car. Putting this programs in high schools will relieve parents of the stress of thionking their child might not be able to obtain a license.	Programs & Services Working Group	schools

They also offer author, illustrator, and animator talks; workshops on storytelling, mindfulness  and breathing, and creative writing; as well as activities: improv theater games, art in nature, and urban nature walks. I have read Pacha's Pajamas with kids and they LOVE IT.  Seeing children's live performances of it blow my mind!

188413	Education	Our money should go to the schools. The schools are filled with trash everyday, less students are showing up because of this problem. Other students from different schools visit or vallejo schools for games and notice how dirty our schools are. This need to change quick. I believe this will engage students to come to school more often with a change in being more clean.      The money seems to be going to different things other then education. There were days when some students couldn't show up to school like for example the day after the gas spill. Students still had to show up because Vallejo doesn't have enough money for them not to miss school. There is many reasons where the money should go. This is only one big one.	Programs & Services Working Group	schools				
187262	Electronic Books for Jesse Bethel High School + Ipads	Jesse M. Bethel High School is in need of many improvements. For example, the teachers are working with such limited supplies; it could definitely be improved by adding more funds or giving more supplies to teachers. Additionally, the lack of extracurricular activities at Bethelâ€”sports, events, etc.â€” is not selling to a lot of the students resulting in the lack of enthusiasm and community for those attending Bethel. Furthermore, students point out that some of the gym equipments are worn out and the new ones are usually given through donations. But out of all of these problems, the main problem that should be addressed is the lack of e-textbooks in Bethel.  The district has graciously given Bethel the amazing educational tool called the iPads. This tool has been quite helpful with the students by allowing us to create presentations, research, and edit videos. Though recently, I realized that there was an app in our iPads called Pearson e-text for schools. Sadly, since there wasn't any electronic textbooks that the school has bought, we were unable to use the app.   With the recent change in math and English textbooks, teachers do not currently have any class sets for their students which means that they have to require students to carry those heavy textbooks. Fast Forward to today, the iPads now carries books for both math and English classes. As much as this is great news, the iPads still do not carry books for all classes, unlike American Canyon high school. This means that students still have to carry books for classes such as psychology, Spanish, and physics. I propose that the money that Vallejo will have, should be used to purchase the electronic version of the books that bethel has not purchased already. Also, not all academies have not received the iPads, so I also propose that the iPads should be purchased for each and every single one of the students at Jesse Bethel.

I feel these classes will open up interest in fields not quite known to kids in Vallejo and expose them to a great new range of new job opportunities and careers.

This particular service will be comprised of classes that are primarily funded by nonprofit the cityâ€™s Measure B taxes as well as nonprofit providers, in which a certified staff will offer free, one-on-one financial counseling to clients. The professional counselors will help clients manage their money, reduce debt, plan their financial futures, improve their credit and find affordable banking services. The classes will not only be available to adults who may struggle with money, but for those who are interested in bettering their budgeting as well, even young teens. Although this is a nonprofit institution, the service will have a long-term affect on those who get involved, as they will become more financially knowledgeable as theyâ€™ll learn how to efficiently spend their money.

187534	FireFighter Youth Academy 	I am a cadet at the FireFighter Youth Academy. This November 2016 will be their first year here in Vallejo. This Academy is know for three main things; Academic Achievement, Community Service, and Self-Discipline. In my own experience, I know these three things are being promoted and achieved. This Academy has brought me many opportunities for school and my future. As a senior, there are many things involving scholarships and applications. The staff has pushed me into keeping up my grades and helping me with the application process. This has helped me get that weight off of my shoulders. They truly want every single cadet to leave the program with set goal ahead of them. The staff is always looking for more ways to make us succeed in our everyday lives. They also teach you life essentials in case of emergency. For example, in these pasts 7/8 months, I have learned about fire safety, CRP, basic first-aid, and what to do during an earthquake. These are only the few subjects that we learn about.         This program is every Saturday except on holidays. From 9am-1pm. During those four hours, we are set up in squads, one person known as the lieutenant leads there squad to their assignment. The assignment could be cleaning inside, outside, washing the fire engine, or cooking breakfast for everyone. This has increased our responsibilities at home. I learned how to cooked. I heard from many of the other cadets that they started to do chores at home and cooking for their family, leaving them surprised as ever. Many has increased their GPA too. The program makes sure that we keep up our grades. They make sure that our GPA improves with providing resources for tutoring and we have to turn in a grade check, at the end of the month, if we increase or maintained our grades we get a stipend rewarding our hard work. Outside of the program, we try to volunteer in community events, helping the community to get to know who we are and giving back to them.   If someone wanted to take their career in being a Firefighter or EMT, this would also bring a great opportunity. We meet other firefighters and EMT's every weekend. They tell us about their experience and if they want to continue with their occupation. Many EMT's also explain how they take this path first to get some experience before becoming a nurse or firefighter. A lot of cadet meet with their mentors. Cadets get to do ride alongs with EMT or spend a day at the fire station for more experience.   In the end, the Firefighter Youth Academy brings many positive effect for young teens who want to go further   in the Fire Department or becoming an EMT. They help us succeed in our academic life and persona life, making us better people.  	Programs & Services Working Group	youth activities

188200	Mentors for Struggling Students in Vallejo	Hello! My name is Angelica Maligat and I would like for you to consider starting a program designed for on-campus â€œmentorsâ€ at the schools here in Vallejo. I find that a major issue for some students within the schools is the lack of desire for their education, which is such a missed opportunity. These students are either unfocused during class, avoiding work, or even skipping school and/or classes altogether. With this program, these students in need of help can consult with someone older, as young as a college student or even a senior citizen, who has lived with the same lifestyle the students are currently living, how it was leading them towards the wrong path and their experiences and motivation to turn it around. In results of this program, we should be able to see a large strive forward in getting kids to grasp their education while they can so we can create a better image for Vallejo schools and itâ€™s students.

187270	Mindfulness in Education 	The effectiveness of mindfulness to transform our schools, communities and our worlds is an unparalleled force and it's just the beginning.  The studies of Jon Kabat Zinn who took hospital patients with chronic pain and taught them mindfulness (later termed MBSR-mindfulness based stress reduction) had wild findings.  Many patients reported having dramatically less pain.  What happened?  They learned how to be in relationship with what is in a way that did not continue the emotional & physical inflammation in response to it.  This in turn created less pain. After Jon Kabat Zin pioneered mindfulness in hospitals school based curriculum is now available and is very effective!  Mindfulness helps children learn to self regulate and calm down effectively bringing their logical mind back on board when upset and able to make good decisions.  Another facet of mindfulness is that it develops loving kindness practices and this offers practice to our children and ourselves to look to each other with compassion overcoming impulses towards aggression; learning how to breathe, calm down & make good choices.      These organizations specialize in coming into schools and doing this work:     mindful life project (based out of Richmond Ca)  http://mindfullifeproject.org/  courage of care   http://courageofcare.org/  Seeds of Awareness   http://www.seeds-of-awareness.org/  Niroga   http://www.niroga.org/training/dm/	Programs & Services Working Group	youth activities

188055	Multi-lingual translators at Vallejo schools for ESL students	There are no translators at schools leaving bilingual students to step up to the job and help new English speaking students learn material. It distracts the bilingual students from focusing on their work sometimes and doesn't guarantee that the bilingual student can teach the concept completely or that the new ESL student can fully comprehend it. Vallejo schools should provide translators for all ESL students because they should have an equal opportunity to achieve education and should not feel left out or ignored.

188196	Support programs	Vallejo is known as one of the most "dangerous" cities in the nation. When you ask another NorCal resident what they think of Vallejo, their response most likely has something to do with the crimes that happen in our city. In my opinion, I strongly believe we can put a stop to this. I believe the crime that happens has a lot to do with the economic factors that take place in a city like Vallejo. However, people can change even if the economy cannot. Despite the reputation of Vallejo, people only point out the negatives but listen little to Vallejoâ€™s positive side. Perception on life has a lot to do with a personâ€™s actions. Many choose to commit a burglary or robbery because they feel like they have no other choice. Many choose to murder because they would do anything to get what they want. Many of these people feel alone and helpless and need help they donâ€™t think they need.   As a teenage resident of Vallejo, I understand the stress a lot of people my age go through. Many Vallejo teens come from families that barely make enough to get by. While some take on part time jobs, others result to what seems much simpler- robbery. I believe if Vallejo set up or encouraged a support group for teenagers and adults in need, there would not be as many crimes in our city. Many people just need advice or help to get on the right track. A mentor system would also be a great idea. This may consist of a person guiding a struggling person to get a job, for instance. Many people are seeking for guidance they do not get from their homes. Large numbers of residents in Vallejo do not get the support they need.

Painting bike lanes down Tennessee Street from the East side neighborhoods over the highway to downtown would help to connect the city for cyclists, provide a safer, more visible space for cyclists, make it more inviting to ride from the neighborhoods in the east to the west, and help to calm traffic on Tennessee on the East Side of highway 80.

181588	Correct Alienating Retaining Walls on Carolina Street	The alienating retaining walls and fencing on Carolina Street at Santa Clara (and westward) scream urban blight. They need reconfiguring, but at the very least, need resurfacing.    An ideal solution would restore Carolina to a narrow street and restore front lawns, ceding the 80-foot-from-center easement.     Corner bulb-outs would create an entry-point to District, and an opportunity to monumentize the entry.     Barring that, resurfacing and new fencing that doesn't rust would greatly enhance this entry point to SVH Historic District -- a District born to stop the City misfeasance that created the abominable retaining walls in the first place.

There are several gas, food & hotel locations in Vallejo but few with adequate signage/visibility from freeway nor easily accessed from freeway when hauling trailer.

177021	Repurpose (to basketball courts) or Resurface Horseshoe Pits @CityPark	We suggest replacing the old horse shoe pits with basketball courts to be enjoyed by a larger segment of our community; or at the very least, resurfacing them, for safety and beautification.   ---------------    Every Mon-Fri from 8-9 am, year round, an average of 25-35 community members engage in a free Tai Chi practice offered by a generous local teacher at City Park's horse shoe pits (come join us!).     In several areas of the lot, the surface is crumbling to sand. In others, there are patch repairs, or there are deep cracks with weeds leaving a surface so uneven it creates difficulty for everyone, especially those with balance issues or disabilities. Additionally, there are wooden covers for each sand pit that are rotting through.     It appears as if the horse shoe pits are no longer used (or very rarely used), and as are they are not being well maintained, we suggest replacing them with basketball courts that could be enjoyed by a wider segment of the community population. The smoother court surface would rectify issues for the Tai Chi group, and offer a much needed recreation area in the heart of downtown.

182958	Substandard and Dangerous Paving	When I voted for Measure B, I was under the impression I was voting for our ridiculously un-maintained street paving phenomenon to END, ensuring driver safety and an end to the high costs associated with wheel alignments, popped tires and the now-necessary to drive with...sports bras.  While heavily trafficked residential side-streets and main arteries become riddled with recurrent, deep trenches, I was quite perturbed a couple years ago to witness the City boldly ordered and paid for a very expensive, permanent-type white metal refective street large sign (approx. 1.5' x 1') to be erected at the entrance to Crownpointe, a recently re-paved street. I was already questioning the logic in repaving this previously well-maintained street before the sign went up. Did our Measure B tax dollars actually budget for these permanent (although temporary since they were soon removed) reflective street signs merely to brag/impress someone on this obscure, under-traveled residential court? What a waste of money! Where's the logic and accountability?  I also think it was wrong and insulting to see residents being asked to foot this neglect, waste and abuse on the recent ballot, as if we don't learn from our mistakes.  Is Vallejo hoping we will soon become desperate enough (again) to foot the bill ourselves out of good will? Sadly, we did this with Measure B and learned our lesson.  Let's stick with the real reason we voted for Measure B in the first place and stop squandering the money on other, made-up, unnecessary suggestions and fix our streets ONCE (TWICE?) AND  FOR ALL!

Being as though Mare Island will be boosting its visitor and employment opportunities in the near future why not encourage greater bike commuter access now to help reduce the inevitability of more traffic.  Tennessee would be a perfect place to start this process, green lane indication for all bike commuters improving safety, health and the environment.

The bridge going to 37 does have an entrance for pedestrians/bikers, but weeds were growing at the entrance and it wasn't clear to me at the beginning where the entrance was.

190436	Convert Historic Victorian (Herbert) House into a Historic Design Center	Its been decades that this Historic Herbert House had been vacated and the attempt to find a suitable tenant had not been successful for many, many years.  The 3-level structures was found to be suitable for occupancy after the August 24th, 2014 earthquake, except for minor repairs.  Rather than waiting for a tenant to rent the place, the City of Vallejo can open it's door for members of the members of the Board and Commission who can volunteer to work pro-bono in the Design Center for any question related to future projects in Vallejo.  The concept is similar to the Design Design Center in key cities in United States.  It will be run by non-profit organization to: 1) help some Vallejoans whose budget are so limited to new construction and/or restore, rehabilatate or refurbish their homes.  2)  For any project applicant who wants to be familiar with city building ordinance, zoning and general plan.  This Victorian (Herbert) House restoration project can qualify for a matching grant from the National Historic Preservation up to $40,000.  The Design Center will be equipped with combined  PB funds, private donations and grants from Historic Preservation organizations and will be manned by devoted professionals in Vallejo, and/or members of the city commissions and boards.      The purpose of establising a Design Center is to help the project applicants with design guidelines and zoning restrictions, before they even spend money hiring professionals for the service intended.  In the Design Center,  any project applicant can view previously approved projects similar to theirs, that can guide them with conceptuallizing their own projects, without spending a lot of money, not aware that their project may not be feasible.   It will also help the city staff alleviate their work load from projects that does not fit the general plan or does not meet design guidelines.  At the center, members of the community will be welcome to view almost every upcoming projects in the city, thus improving the city's transparency, eliminating suspicion of improriety and impermissible bias to certain upcoming projects within the city's growing and improving environment.  Presently, members of the the board and the commission are given no more than 7 days to view projects that will be deliberated in the regular meeting.  For members who are still employed full time, they often come to the regular meeting unprepared or are not fully abreast of the whole aspects of the proejcts presented before them.  If these projects are made available at a Design Center for the board and commission members and the viewing public, the city is giving enough time for everyone to study, research and come to educated information for how the proposed projects would make Vallejo, a better place to live, invest, work and play.      The most common complaint that we hear everytime from the members of the community is not being informed before hand, or perhaps, not giving enough notices to know and learn about upcoming projects.  And this is understandable for a city that went understaff  from almost all the department after emerging from the bankruptcy.  But the city should recognize that there are so many members of the community who are willing to devote some time to help make Vallejo better.      The Victorian (Herbert)House was donated to the city and should be used for the common interest of the city and its people.  A Design Center will be a place where the city and the people can share ideas and solutions for a common good.   	Public Safety & Infrastructure Working Group	buildings

I believe that the extension of Bart would be of great use in the city of Vallejo and the North Bay. Bart is critical for many people to get to their desired destination. However, Vallejo is in absence of the Bart experience. The closest stations to Vallejo are either Concord, El Cerrito and/or Richmond. All of the stations are still a commuting distance, meaning people would still need to drive down there, and at the same time polluting the air we breath. Bart wouldn't just help the people in our community by saving them gas money and saving them time, but it will also help our natural environment. With the reduction of automobiles being drove and the reduction of emissions entering our environment, we'd be helping this planet of ours. After all we do only have one planet earth.

There are people who travel to ride BART but because Richmond is a bad neighborhood, many go to the El Cerrito del Norte station.

188206	Improvement to the VCUSD	  If I was given money through the Participatory Budget, I would do anything to make our Vallejo schools better environment. I, as a student, have witnessed our deteriorated, filthy, gross, and unattainable environment in our schools. Our schools are molded with black gums stained all over the cement, and marinated with urine on the bathroom tiles, and unsanitized classrooms. Our breakfast and lunch meals are like prison food that we, students, have to force ourselves to like the taste or eventually - throw it in the trash; thus, we waste food. Most students address the fact about using bathrooms is rare and only necessary, meaning our bathrooms are unclean and unhygienic. For example, the common knowledge that we already know there isnâ€™t any toilet paper or soap illustrates how dirty our schools can be. When we walk in classrooms, the air isnâ€™t fresh to breathe. We wish for air conditioners to work perfectly, but not all classrooms have one nor does it function properly. Another concern is the classes we take. Although our schools choose our classes based on the A-G requirements, we wish for classes that relate to hands-on classes like cooking, to let us focus and apply the ability to real-life skills that could lead us for adulthood, college, or a new hobby. The last thing I would spend money on through this budget, is by hiring teachers who have a well advised credibility through their profile because more appropriate teaching skills means a higher chance a student will understand their classes and a higher rate of students passing their classes and graduating.   Schools are important to create an environment suitable for students for a better education. We go to school that is part of our lives for at least 12 years from where we not only learn, but we socialize and are raised in the Vallejo city that causes our behaviors to lead to a positive effect or a negative effect. We all should acknowledge the fact our schools really make a huge impact in our lives(not just children and teenagers, but teachers, families, parents, the Superintendent - the whole Vallejo City Unified School District) and by improving the the schools where we sit in class for 7 hours a day can really motivate students the will to learn and not give up in their education.

188347	Making Vallejo Schools Better	     I believe the city of Vallejo should spend Measure B tax dollars on making the schools in Vallejo better. Education is a huge part of who we are and how we move forward with our lives. Being a high school student at Jesse M. Bethel High School, I want my peers, as well as the future students to have a true education. Most teachers aren't willing to put their full effort towards teaching their students and the learning environment in Vallejo is not the best. With putting money towards the schools, the city of Vallejo can truly make an impact on the people who have grown up here and reside here. Walking around my high school, I am always seeing vandalism on the walls and trash scattered all over the floor. Putting money towards the school systems can truly make our lives great.        With the Measure B tax dollars, schools can take their students on more educational field trips. For example, high school students should be able to be exposed to seeing colleges and learning what they have to offer so they can move forward with their lives after college. There are a class set of textbooks in each class but, they are torn apart and written all over, with the money we can be able to replace these books with new ones. At Jesse M. Bethel, we have to chance to use Ipads for our education and that was a great step to enhancing our education. We need more reasons to be pushed to move forward after high school as well. Kids who attend school during elementary shouldn't have to play in playgrounds that are written all over with foul language. With extra money, we can have these kids play in new playgrounds. With putting money towards our school systems, we don't only change our education but, the future for all students. It will give them a sense of hope that their education does not end after high school.  	Public Safety & Infrastructure Working Group	school

190335	Revamp & Revitalize JFK Library	As downtown Vallejo continues to develop and flourish, we should send the message to our community and visitors that we value and prioritize learning by revamping and revitalizing the JFK Library. Over the years the JFK Library has definitely lost its sparkle. It doesn't have the warm and inviting atmosphere that everyone looks for in a library. Instead it seems dirty, unappealing, and outdated. I purpose that the outside of the library is remodeled as many of the areas are now blocked off due to homeless encampments and the inside is supplied with new desks, carpet, etc. The JFK Library should serve as a centerpiece to our growing and vibrant downtown area.    In addition, I would love to see added services to the library, some ideas include:  --Workshops and classes for local businesses and entrepreneurs, such as marketing and social media (this will help the local economy)  --Tool library where you can borrow tools that you many only once in a while (this is a service the Berkeley library offers)  --Other services to develop the "sharing economy" in Vallejo          The JFK Library deserves a second life.

They are usually not really thought of and not made better compared to other schools outside of Vallejo. For example, the american canyon high school/middle school is a good quality school. They have nice bathrooms with working sinks, a working gardening section, comfortable classes, nice track field, nice tennis courts, they even have solar panels and more. Comparing them to schools in Vallejo, we do not have better quality schools like they have. The bathrooms are raggedy, the sinks do not completely work, most lockers do not work, the basket ball quarts are old and most schools do not even have a gardening section. It would be a good idea to spend some of the measure B tax dollars, on Vallejo schools.	Public Safety & Infrastructure Working Group	school

190445	Solano Middle School Crosswalk Project - 1025 Corcoran Avenue	Solano Middle School, located on Corcoran Avenue in North Vallejo, should have a crosswalk in front of the school.  This project would not only benefit students arriving/departing to/from school each day, but the residents that live in a gated community across the street from Solano Middle School as well.  A SolTrans bus stop is located directly across from the driveway of the gated homes, but the closest place to cross the street safely is a 1/4 mile in the west direction, and about half that distance in the east direction.  During drop off/pickup times before and after school, the amount of traffic creates an unsafe environment for students. Students have no designated safe place to cross the street, so they do so at their own risk.  Solano Middle School and its students should be able to arrive at and depart from school without having to fear for their safety in the process.      The cost for this project, according to the City of Vallejo Public Works Department, is $26.000.      The installation of a crosswalk requires that the crosswalk meet ADA standards and must include handicap accessible ramps on the each side.  The VCUSD claims that funding is not available for such a project.  This idea is an effort to reach out to the community & hopefully make Corcoran Avenue a safer place to cross the street in North Vallejo.

However, the beauty of many of these districts is marred by outdated means of distributing utilities including electricity and phone lines. While current standards call for subterranean deployment of utilities, these areas are served by utility poles and overhead lines, items which take away from the beauty of these neighborhoods.     This project would allow the City of Vallejo to work with utility companies and neighborhood homeowners to remove those wires and poles, redistributing existing services through underground cables. Potentially, new technology such as fiber optic to the home could be deployed as well. 	Public Safety & Infrastructure Working Group	power

188181	The schools of Vallejo	Education is the most important factor in which Vallejo should focus on. The city of Vallejo has schools that are doing well, but the school and its students cannot flourish because of the limited amount of money invested in them. Education will never fail, putting in money into Vallejo schools will improve each child's performance, reduce crime rates, and attract more people into the city. One of the benefits that would serve Vallejo for the long run is having students in school instead of them roaming around the streets. Our students have the potential to thrive but the quality of the school is what discourages them and feel as if they are degraded by their neighboring cities. Investing money to the schools of Vallejo is like watering seeds, give the children more resources and they will revolutionize the face of Vallejo. Ultimately, the schools will improve and new families would want to come into what Vallejo truly is, rich in culture and diversity. Who wouldn't want to come into a city that accepts every culture and have excellent schools?	Public Safety & Infrastructure Working Group	school

188384	Vallejo Participatory Budget	Despite my brief living experience in Vallejo for just about a year, personal safety in my opinion is my major concern. According to the FBI , Vallejo is 6th most dangerous city in the Bay Area, on average 8.61 out of 1,000 resident in Vallejo committed at least 1 violent crime, which includes homicide, murder, assault, manslaughter, sexual assault, rape, robbery, negligence, endangerment, kidnapping (abduction), extortion, and harassment. This really troubles me because I could never let my guard down once I leave my doorstep, I had to constantly observe my surroundings and look for potential dangers, â€œget in & get outâ€ is my personal rule of thumb every time I walk on Vallejo streets.     To solve the crime issue in Vallejo, I propose hiring more law enforcements. According to CNN , after the police force was cut down by 40%, crime rate surged with more than two dozen homicides, compared to only seven in 2006. This demonstrates that crime rate has an association with the amount of law enforcements, which suggests that as more police roam around the streets, less probable criminals will likely commit a crime. Vallejo is a wonderful place to live in, the weather and the scenic is absolutely stunning, the only thing keeping wealthy and or morally good people from living here is the crime rate. Once it has been dealt with, I am certain the overall income per household in Vallejo would rise and the city will once again be able to self-run without the help from the government, making Vallejo even a better place to live in.    ____________________________________________________  1.

188419	Vallejo Schools (High Schools) Bathroom problem & educational quality	As a fourth-year high school student in Jesse Bethel, I have noticed many things I and fellow peers have grown critical over. The wide spread complaint all students share would be the issues with our restrooms. They are unsanitary and without resources. There is never any soap, tissue, working locks in the bathroom stalls, adequate mirrors or lighting. Out of all the things we request to be fixed in our school, restrooms would be a great place to start. Having a restroom is a necessity in the 7 hours we are in school, but the horrible state it is in discourages many students from actually using them. Also, not having any soap is completely unsanitary after using the toilet and can spread germs after leaving the restroom. Fixing the state of our restrooms would improve the quality of comfort in Jesse Bethel, and other schools as well if implemented to all Vallejo schools.  Another thing I found to be frustrating is the academy structure. While some believe it is helpful for students to explore fields in their desired profession, it creates more confusion for undecided students and wastes one period with an academy class they are uninterested in. I propose an investment on increasing educational program quality in Vallejo high schools to assist students in finding potential interests for a future profession. I believe they can do this in two ways. The academy structure does not have to fully disappear. But the addition of giving the students a chance to not claim an academy or having students be able to experience all academies would be a great addition to give students more autonomy of their own educational experience. Letting a student experience all academies and not having to commit to one allows them to experiment with completely different fields to determine which suits them best. This system is helpful for the completely oblivious and indecisive students who are interested in a myriad of subjects. The other choice to allow a no academy allows students to explore interests through the classes they choose. For example, they can choose extra math classes or elective classes to explore their interests which they may have been unable to do if their schedules were blocked by an academy class. This leads to my other point to invest in our educational programs, such as physical education, science, and art departments. A higher quality education would involve a higher quality and quantity resources to improve and expand our learning abilities. For example, lab equipment to perform more lab experiments in our science classes. Also, the creation of varied classes would help students experiment with new subjects. These improvements can outcome in a higher student involvement and interest in education and a further exploration of career choices.  	Public Safety & Infrastructure Working Group	school

Stocked with kitchen utensils and dishes.  This is different than a rec center because it is much nicer, cozier and suitable for use by any group that needs a larger space than a home to host a dinner.      Maybe Vallejo has a building that could be put to good use for community cooking classes  and events. Local chefs, farmers market, nutritionists etc can create a cooperative for the benefit of healthier citizens. 	Quality of Life Working Group	education

Solano College Vallejo Centerâ€˜s intimate learning environment is a readily accessible location for the community and public to view the public art piece.    Notably, the city of Vallejo has recently been designated a â€œCollege Town.â€  Solano College Vallejo Center is fast becoming Vallejoâ€™s important public space for education.  Many parents, studentsâ€”K-12 and college, and community members visit, enroll in the wide array of courses, host and attend multicultural, educational, and other community events, and receive services at the Vallejo Center.   Solano College has the grounds to locate the art project.    The public art will reflect the community values regarding education.   The process of defining and deciding the public art will be guided by artistic expertise and community involvement.      The outcome will be public art that is part of our community history and a chronicle of our community experience.   	Quality of Life Working Group	public art

"HONOR THOSE THAT HAVE WALKED BEFORE YOU, FOR IT IS THE PATH YOU WILL LEARN FROM"	Quality of Life Working Group					
170792	Create an Upscale Flea Market	We need to generate business in the community and vision for growth. An upscale flea Market that is family friendly and not over priced to have space can create a wonderful environment to incubate new business. This ought to be done with a minimum of 30 acres of land. Recommend a great place to do this is near the open space across from Mare Island between the Mare Island Bridge and Hwy 37 or at the county fair grounds so you can create good parking and easy access from multiple directions.  As an example look what a town of 5,100 can do when you do it right! In Canton, "Texas the tradition began with district court meetings held on the first Monday of each month, or with the monthly visit of neighbors. The custom began with the swapping of surplus stock by barter and grew to include casual bargaining for or swapping of dogs, antiques, junk, and donkeys on a 30-acre (120,000 m2) grounds. It is so immensely popular, that Canton goes from a town of 5,100 to a town of over 300,000 during the first Monday weekend, making it the largest flea market in the world." Now that is worth developing and we can do this here in Vallejo and the numbers will swell up quickly. We do not have to be first in the market, just do it right in the market and people will come.   	Quality of Life Working Group	retail

177059	Drive-ins	Judging by the immense success of the Solano Drive-in/swap-meets in Concord, Vallejo would be wise to capitalize on that family-friendly market. Many 40-something's and up remember the Vallejo drive-ins as a valued, multi-generation tradition and reminisce fondly. The added benefit of a place to peddle our surplus belongings would provide a far safer atmosphere than online when selling things to strangers, as well as ensuring items go to a good home as opposed to the landfill potentially. Vallejo's entreprenureal spirit should have an informal place to thrive and provide a little pocket money for sellers while shoppers get to find perfectly good used items to save their hard-earned money. I believe in avoiding chain stores whenever possible and buying local first. It wouldnt take much to compete with Concord and bring another popular venue (and current eyesore) back to life, even if we had to start with the flea market, then progress to developing the drive-in improvements using those profits over time.

182830	Future Projects	We need the following stores in Vallejo somewhere in the area by the Columbus Parkway Automall area where the Solano Community College is at by Lowes, Toyota, etc.  We also need to build a Super Center Walmart back in Vallejo where it use to be located at the Meadows Plaza.  That area is a sore eye since Walmart left, now it's just a wasted dead parking lot with growing weeds and more empty spaces since Food Max also left and Home Depot has deserted the space.  Build a Trader Joes food store in Vallejo, a Vegas Style Casino in Mare Island, more retail businesses, food buffet restaurants, etc.  This will bring more people to Vallejo instead of always driving to Fairfield to go to Trader Joes or San Francisco.  There is a lot of empty spaces along Sonoma with nothing but huge weeds growing near the Meadows Plaza with no businesses, why?  If Vallejo had the big Vegas Style Casino that was offered numerous times by the Indians at Mare Island, more people would've visited by now.  We could've had the Olympics held in the Bay Area by now.  Wake up and see that people are interested in Action, not going to an Industrial former Naval Base with past memories of the Military.  It would be nice to lower the monthly costs of the Ferry prices and free parking for hard working people trying to make ends meet.  All this time, and Vallejo still doesn't have it together by now.  We need NEW LEADERS who aren't afraid to take a chance and do something different, make it happen, earn interest instead of debt, give consumers what they're asking for.  There are houses by Columbus Parkway AutoMall who would really like to see a "Trader Joes" Market built so the people who don't have cars can walk to it and shop.

168369	Help us Restore the Mare Island Logo on the big blue Causeway Bridge!	  We are soliciting engineering solutions, donations, gifts and help from the citizens of Vallejo to help us pay for the restoration of the Mare Island Logo on the Ed Wichels Causeway Bridge.  The logo is prominently visible as one travels onto Mare Island from Vallejo, CA.    Mare Island Naval Shipyard employees and U.S. Navy personnel have a proud tradition of service on Mare Island, and the Mare Island logo mounted over the causeway was a bright, shiny symbol of the future, the state of our jobs and the Navyâ€™s mission to build and repair ships.  Sadly, that same logo is fading away, just as the many memories we all had of the greatest and oldest Naval Base and Shipyard on the West Coast.    Help us preserve the history of Mare Island, and the memory of the employees whose contributions and sacrifice of American labor created the oldest naval shipyard on the west coast of the United States. The 20th anniversary of closing Mare Island was on April 1, 2016.    We estimate that it will take anywhere from $5 to $25,000 in funds will be required to restore the logo. As a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, the Mare Island Historic Park Foundation receives no funds from the U.S. Navy, and relies on the generous gifts and contributions of individual donors and corporate sponsors. All gifts are tax deductible and are recognized appropriately.

Vallejo's youth truly need a POSITIVE PLACE where they can go to    They have no options; other than hanging in the streets; and this often leads to petty crimes; which tends to gravitate to more serious crimes as they get older.    GVRD is great, but they do not serve the demographic that is in dire need:    *Our youth need mentorship, guidance, and discipline   *They need to feel wanted & important   *They need to be encouraged and supported   *They need a place that promotes self-discovery; a place that caters to their various interests   *They need to learn accountability, integrity, and resposibility  *...and most of all, they need a place they WANT to go to, to have fun!     The Boys & Girls Club of America is more than willing to help with implementing a new club; with the help of BGC of Vacaville.

Project submitted by experienced small film writer-producer, local downtown artist Julian Phillips. Seeking $50,000 and up, to finance such as: a) ten to fifteen high-school students will participate on project for six months, July 2017 to Jan. 2018. b) under supervision, students will contract to create and produce all aspects of a 90-minute Independent Feature Film. c) work will proceed in Vallejo and locations nearby; students can be as creative as they wish within normal guidelines for drama, comedy, 'action', documentary, science-fiction, at least 90-min. d) completed 90-min feature film will become the property of the City of Vallejo under PB process terms. e) funds needed to operate a six-month 'after school' or 'weekends only' class or program, including field work and on-set locations, minor personal travel. Examples would include rental cameras, edit-bay, lights, costumes, props, permits and insurance, casting, music. f) Mr. Phillips may, or may not, be the Team Leader. Mr. Phillips is a downtown artist (known for his Twofish Guitar Shows), and has been teaching media arts classes since 2009, including award-winning entries in last year's Waterfront Weekend 'Troll Story' contest, written by students from his American Canyon classes. Other local video artists and teachers would be invited to lead. g) funds would necessarily provide a small 'stipend fee', for all participants, to motivate students (at for example $75 per month, each), and also secure semi-professional status and credits. h) ten to fifteen students (high school level or proficient), would take on all film-maker duties, such as cast or dramatic actors, camera and sound/lights, costumes, script and screenplay writing, director or team of directors, film-video editor(s), producer, computer, etc. The entire group would work together for six months on all aspects. i) by the end of the Class, students can recieve DVD copies of their work, can earn school credits, are awarded certificate of acheivement, can apply screen credits for professional Unions (such as SAG), and follow-up with distribution and release of the film-video, online such as Vimeo or Amazon Prime, and locally with a big Premiere Party (Empress Theater or similar venue), for the entire community to enjoy the finished film.     The project would function much like a 'part time job' for teens and high school students interested in film-video arts. Six month's time period for completion would allow successful editing, post-production. Finished film could be entered in film-festivals, created as a web-series, and build resumes and confidence. Students may be low-income or from abusive backgrounds, (with guidance). Vallejo High School and City of Vallejo would be invited to participate in the process on certain aspects    *No guarantee implied or intended.

Cover the Alley in murals as well to create a beautiful gem in our city. Implementing this in Indian Alley will create a small tourist attraction and during Art Walks we can have vendors as well and it would connect/ expand the Art Walk from Sacramento to Sonoma Blvd businesses and galleries.

190695	Bay Area Stage Productions of Vallejo	Bay Area Stage Productions is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, and has been an active Arts support and provider system in Vallejo for seven years. Specifically, Bay Area Stage provides local residents with opportunities to participate in a wide range of live stage productions, comprised of comedies, dramas, musicals as well as offering educational cirriculum in theatre arts. To date, more than 500 local residents have participated in our theatrical productions, as performers, technical personel and educators. In 36 fully staged productions, we have welcomed more than 20,000 patrons from Vallejo as well as from surrounding areas.    Our childrens theatre program, Bay Area Stage Junior, provides low and middle income families with theatre education and performance opportunities for children, ages 6 to 18. Bay Area Stage Junior has completed six,   9-week workshops in 3 years and offers scholarship programs and discounted rates to all families in need.    Bay Area Stage hosts a wide variety of visiting local performing artists, including local opera, and original works by emerging artists and musicians. We are always happy to provide our patrons with information about Vallejo shopping, restaurants, and current events. Bay Area Stage Productions supports Vallejo.    It is our hope, and that of our rapidly growing patron base, that Bay Area Stage Productions is worthy to receive monies from the Participatory Budgeting program to help our non-profit pay for real costs, such as set materials, lighting and sound equipment, venue rental and improvements.

190422	Bring Arts to Youth in Vallejo	The arts are being cut in the schools. Bring the arts back into the schools by creating a network of artists who will teach local youth especially middle and low income youth. Work with schools and other community partners to offer art programming in Visual, Performing, and STEAM based art education. Give youth the skills they need to go into this high tech world and provide paid opportunities for artists at the same time.

188483	Brush and bulky clean up/ More free dump days	To reduce the amount of garbage in neighborhoods, and especially large items dumped on green spaces, I proposed more free days at the local dump as well as several brush and bulky clean up days, where residents can put out old junk and large yard waste for the city. This would prevent these items from ending up near the train tracks or in a park, saving the city the trip to pick it up after it have been illegally dumped. To a cleaner Vallejo!

188201	City Park	If playgrounds and parks were added to Vallejo, then children would be able to experience the outdoors more efficiently. The parks would also provide more family bonding time instead of staying cooped up at home. There would be a reason to go outside in nature if there was a park nearby. Alternatively, children can be involved in outdoor activities instead of playing with their electronic devices. City parks can be a crucial antidote to these unhealthy trends. They can motivate young people to learn through the natural environment.	Quality of Life Working Group	parks				
189565	Civic Arts Center	Developing a community Arts, Music and Healing Center for teaching a wide variety of creative classes for adults in Vallejo would add to the life and joy of our city.

190087	Clean Air Monitoring Network - No Measurements means No Management!	Don't Take Clean Air for Granted!    With the September 20, 2016  toxic fume incident (concurrent with Phillips 66 oil spill), It is very clear that neither BAAQMD (Bay are air quality management district) nor city of Vallejo has the infrastructure/capability to monitor the air quality, let alone the ability to alert citizens of harm.    This post is a call for action to start a "Clean Air Monitoring Network" PB project to start this effort.    Vallejo has very high asthma rate, do we know why? Who are the polluters? Is it from the heavy industries in the city? is it from the refinery outside of the city? Who do you think will identify the polluting sources for us? Who?....If not ourselves?    More specifically, black population in our city has as high as 5 times the ER visit rate (due to asthma) when compared with state average and for all residents, the ER visit rate is as high as 2.5 times the state average. This extra high ER visit rate is not acceptable and has to be looked into.    As the saying goes, " No measurements, no management." So the first goal of the "Clean Air Monitoring Network" is to establish monitoring stations in different part of the city and establish baseline measurement of air quality.    Once we have the baseline measurements, then we can monitor changes and keep our air clean.    This project will take a group effort to accomplish and will benefit many residents in the city.

189105	Cleanup	I believe that Vallejo, California is in need of neighborhood enhancements. That is, assigning a specific day of the week in which volunteers can pick up the litter around our neighborhoods. Not only will this be beneficial to the environment, but it can be beneficial to the visitors/newcomers as well. It wonâ€™t hurt to clean our city just a bit, considering that animals around here are feeding off of the garbage being thrown around.  This isnâ€™t needed just around neighborhoods, but around Vallejo schools as well. Students should have the opportunity to help the custodians clean up our schools, and volunteer hours should also be given when completing this task. That way, we can convince students to make a difference as well as motivate them to earn volunteer hours, as this is an important factor to consider when applying to college.

187508	Encouraging Business Advancement 	I have been a citizen of Vallejo since 2001.For the past six years, I have been a resident of the  College Park neighborhood of Northern Vallejo. As everyone knows, a few months ago, Food 4 Less closed for business permanently. Currently, there are sparse business establishments in that shopping square. I propose an idea that more businesses are installed. It is in a good location and easily accessible for both patrons of Vallejo, American Canyon, Napa and surrounding towns. Several years ago when Walmart moved from Vallejo to American Canyon, there were promises of a Home Depot being placed there. But so far, I have not seen any progress being made  into this project. I don't know if the plan was just hearsay or the building project was detained due to low funding. But whatever the reason,  the building has been trespassed by transients in the past. I realize that the homeless situation in Vallejo is unfortunately prevalent. Personally,  I feel that if more businesses were brought into that shopping square, it would bring in new job opportunities for the citizens of Vallejo. It would also give the homeless an opportunity to get on their feet and get a chance of living productive lives for themselves and their families. The plazas where Century Theaters and Seafood City are situated are doing pretty well for themselves business-wise. It would be wonderful and a great business advancement to see an additional plaza in Vallejo doing successfully as well.	Quality of Life Working Group	retail,shopping

190427	Establish  Urban Farming in South Vallejo	There is a huge unused lot in the borders of the Community Center and the Grace Paterson Elementary School which can be converted to a moderate size urban farm.  Urban Farming will not only give Vallejoans an alternative healthy choice of fresh produce 365 days every year, but it will also give a chance to the unemployed deserving Vallejoans the pride of a  hard day's work and learn new trade that can eventually turn into steady income.     The 2016 General Plan on its way to be approved calls for Urban Farming in South Vallejo, which is most fitting considering that the area needs much needed boost.  The PB dollar will spearhead that long awaited plan to give the residents and business owners in this part of town the pride of being where they are.  The idea is not new,  its been tested in hundreds of small and large cities all over USA.  Many parks, front yards and vacant lands are being used for urban farming, rather than remain in blighted condition.    The open space between Grace Paterson Elelmentary School and the Community Center are presently maintained by the GVRD with lawns that need to be kept clean and green regualrly.  This lawn can be replaced with vegetable, fruit, herb and many other green farms that will benefit the neighboring community and the rest of Vallejoans, hundredfold than what this open space is being used at present.    This project idea had been presented to PB in the past, but unfortunately missed deadline of submissions and the many hours of research and studies did not result to anything.  Its a worthy project that has not seen light of  day, and therefore we are trying it again and hopefully this time around, Vallejoans will see the need and the benefits that this project.

188387	Eyes on the Sky	Consistently in Vallejo on the Fourth of July, there are two fundamental spots where firecrackers are shown: Discovery Kingdom and the waterfront. I discover this an issue as a result of one thing, the geology of Vallejo. There are 125,000 individuals in Vallejo and not every one of them is going to need to go to those two firecrackers shows. Indeed, not everybody is going to stay in Vallejo to praise the firecrackers shows in the city. Be that as it may, a ton of the subjects in Vallejo stay at home on the fourth and due to the geography and size of the city, having the capacity to see the showcases can be unthinkable, again relying upon where you are in Vallejo amid the presentations.     Presently this thought may sound somewhat insane, however an additional firecrackers showcase can do ponders for the city on the fourth of July. Of Course that will cost cash, and despite the fact that it's nothing genuine like attempting to settle the streets and roads in the city or discovering approaches to enhance our school, yet it is a thought I am certain very few individuals have conveyed to the table. So that is the reason I suggest that the city think about including as an additional firecrackers showcase for the fourth of July in the years to come.  	Quality of Life Working Group	events

People randomly throw their trash in alleys, sidewalks, and other public places. The fact is that this needs to change because it can be dangerous not only to us, but to our pets and to the environment that we live in.        One reason to why people end up illegally dumping their trash is because it is expensive to pay for it to be picked up, meaning throwing in the nearest isolated alley can be an easy solution. But this can change if trash collection was more affordable. Vallejo is not full of well-paid residents; instead, Vallejo faces a low-intermediate economic intake by majority of its residents so not paying another high bill is seen as a favorable choice.       Affordable maintenance services should be more affordable and be based on a household salary, which will allow more people to afford these kinds of services. If this kind of system is allowed then amounts of trash dumped in public areas can be subject to lower.       Another solution to this problem is to reinforce illegal dumping regulations. One way this can happen is if authorities patrol areas in which dumping is most active. If the individuals see the authorities near the area, then they are bound to think twice before doing it. With this said, if residents see changes then theyâ€™re also bound to rethink and take action for them by making sure areas are kept clean. For example a neighborhood watch can be created. The city of Vallejo has caring and reasonable residents, which is why the Participatory Budget is in place, so help by residents is not a problem.         These are some ways to help reduce illegal dumping in our city, but thereâ€™s many more and in the end it will be beneficial for all of us because we all live in this wonderful, but trashed and poorly taken care of city. Vallejo can be a great city, but it all starts with its environment so even if there are plenty of destinations, the way itâ€™s taken care of is very important.

187714	Improving Community Events	   I believe that Vallejo is becoming a more United city ever since the bankruptcy in 2008. We have been able to climb back up due to all the contributions of the people living in Vallejo. Looking at other cities that I have been able to visit, I have seen many cities that have parks full of people enjoying the sun. One city that caught my attention had an outside stage where people were able to perform and grass surrounding the stage where spectators can enjoy their performance. Not only that but next to the grassy area, There was a park where kids were playing. This very much intrigued me. I saw this city on a friday afternoon when the kids have finished their school and parents have already gotten out of work. Their city was so lively. I wondered if we can have this in Vallejo.           Vallejo is starting to reunite with its spirit of happiness. For example, in the waterfront, some events have been going on there like the food trucks parking on the grassy area and selling their goods. These things help our community grow and reunite. I believe that it would be a great idea if we make an outdoor stage somewhere in the downtown Vallejo area. Though we may have the Saturday Farmers Market, downtown Vallejo populations have declined throughout the years. Downtown Vallejo is suppose to be the place where people would want to go on a Friday afternoon. Either to enjoy the community or have a family outing to eat. The outdoor stage would be a great way to attract performers who would like to perform and people who would like to watch. The budget that would be used to make the stage could be paid off by a fee from performers who would like to use the stage and by spectators who would like to watch.

188481	Mare Island Cooperatives	The city could use land on Mare Island to support community cooperatives that would provide training and employment. A community goat farm would not only keep the weeds down and reduce fire danger, but also produce local artisanal cheeses. Promoting this type of growth would allow for skills development and money to recirculate within the community. Cottage industries of this type on the island would be a proud Vallejo industry that people from the region would like to visit as opposed to a cement plant. There are myriad benefits of the community participating in producing quality food goods, as well as owning the means of producing such goods. 	Quality of Life Working Group	retail,shopping

188397	Mare Island Revitalization	Mare Island used to be a very prestigious part of Vallejo. What used to be the first naval base on the west coast has turned into a run down area. Although there are parts of Mare Island that may seem a bit aesthetic, it is evident that Mare Island needs a bit of revitalization. There are many square feet of vacant space in Mare Island that could be put to good use. There are also many empty and run-down buildings that could be used for things such as cost-friendly, city regulated, apartments affordable for the low income.   There are many instances of fires and vandalism that has occurred in Mare Island because of these vacant buildings. One of these buildings could even be restructured as a homeless shelter. We can also create jobs in Vallejo by introducing more companies to Mare Island. Mare Island is a fairly large place with a great amount of empty space. If we utilize that space, we could not only increase the aesthetic of Mare Island, but we can open to more jobs, provide and shelter the homeless, and even accommodate those who are financially struggling.

187953	Outlets	I believe that we should have outlets out here in Vallejo. The reason why I say we need outlets is because we do not need to drive to Fairfield to go to a mall. We can build outlets and put in stores that we like. This will save gas for lots of people and make it easier to shop for things you need. I believe this will bring Vallejo a lot more money as well such as outside people coming and buying.	Quality of Life Working Group	retail,shopping				
188145	Outlets Proposal	Shopping outlets are a place where people can relax, do some retail therapy, and also get away from what they may face outside of that shopping center.  Vallejo is a community that is filled with exploring adolescents and people with beautiful characteristics. However, due to Vallejo being seen as a â€œghettoâ€ community by those who live outside of the city, the children and people can sometimes believe what they hear and not expect better from themselves. With this in mind, a shopping center/outlet can bring unity to the city by people, instead of being on the streets for various reasons, enjoying time in the outlets.  In addition to the outlets being a sort of get a way, the outlets bring the opportunity to get Vallejo to flourish even more into a well-developed city and can bring in money to the city.  Although the cost to build an outlet maybe be on the expensive side, the income of the outlets are more beneficial, giving this project more positives than negatives.

190594	Public Beach at historical dry docks, Mare Island	I propose that one or both of the old, unused dry-docks directly across the Napa River from the Vallejo Ferry Building be transformed into a public sun and swimming location. I envision towels, blankets and picnickers spread across the concrete slope as it makes its way towards the water. In the water, children play and teenagers and adults swim out within the guarding presence of the tall structured walls. Picnic tables and barbecue pits inhabit the western end towards the road. I believe this would create a public beach, something lacking in the Bay Area, and provide a free, natural alternative to the paid, chlorinated swimming pools. It would incorporate the history of the island and the city and provide a unique tourism destination as well as a resource for the city and its citizens. 	Quality of Life Working Group	parks

187943	Sport complex 	Vallejo is a very unique city and diverse. Our city crime has increased and many have families have suffered from losing family members to gangs or even death. In Vallejo our city has no real community establishment that can bring families closer and the community also. This can also bring in lots of attention to vallejo and make us also profit from it. I propose they we should make a sports complex which will have soccer/Football fields and baseball fields and maybe a gym for volleyball. Making this might be expensive but in the long run we can receive back the money we put into it by hosting tournaments for different sports also having fees to have teams practice there. With this we can now be a stop for people across the bay area thus the environment of vallejo will change and will make vallejo more friendly. 	Quality of Life Working Group	sports

188353	Sports complex	Vallejo's budgeting system should use the Measure B tax dollars on a sports complex. Having a sports complex to me, would keep young kids off the streets and put them into something productive. Sports in general brings people together, gives young kids future dreams and gives people something to look forward to. This sports complex would include all sports, baseball, football, basketball, soccer, tennis, and even a track/field area. This whole sports complex will bring people together because yeah we do have baseball fields and football fields and basketball courts in vallejo, but this will be in one area. This also could bring money back to vallejo because with sports you need to be hydrated so this will mean a snack bar will be needed. With sports there are teams, and with teams there are fans, and with fans there comes and entry fee. Also, there could be a fee charged for when local teams want to practice or use this wonderful new facility.   This facility will bring life to Vallejo, and not just people from our community but from cities all around us. Everyday this complex will be filled with bright young kids or adults who enjoy playing sports. This complex will be a turf facility so that it will need minimum maintenance. This place to me is just a wonderful idea, and yes it might take a little longer than other ideas would but this one will make 10x more of a difference. I have no further ideas for this project, but feel free to add to it when you choose this idea for the Vallejo Participatory Budgeting project.	Quality of Life Working Group	sports

Under expert leadership, children learn to read music, sing healthily and to perform in a professional manner. No experience is required, as Campanelli's tiered program provides instruction for children of all musical levels. Weekly rehearsals are held in Vallejo and Campanelli presents concerts on its own, along with appearing with the Vallejo Choral Society on their regular concerts.

187907	The Sportscenter in Mare Island should be fixed up so athletes can work.	Midnight basketball was great for all the basketball players in vallejo, but instead of just basketball we should have a place for all athletes to go, like the Sportscenter in Mare Island. The Sportscenter needs to be fixed up because its all old and dusty, its not appealing to the eye anymore, on the outside or the inside. They fixed the soccer and football fields but the basketball courts and the batting cages need to be revamped. Injuries have been caused due to the uneven courts. People spending money on the batting cages and sometimes they won't work so its like you got ripped off. About the staying out of trouble because all athletes are competitive so there may be fights because people want to win so that's normal to me. Instead of being out at night hanging out, going to parties, getting unwanted attention by police or people who look like their up to no good, they could just down to the Sportscenter and get better at the sport they love.

189050	Trash Can Screens	The City of Vallejo is currently not enforcing the city code that trash cans must be kept out of view. The reason I was given was that the some people with older homes simply have no place to store them. While I like that the city is being sensitive to individuals needs, I still find seeing trash cans to be an eyesore and source of urban blight. I think a solution could be to meet with citizens who aren't complying with the code, see if there is any way for them to comply and if not, build a screen for them to put their cans behind. This would cost fairly little money. I imagine that the screens could be built by an organization that helps folks fix up their homes. I know there is such a group that does work here in town, but I can't think of the name! The screens though, would not just be for low income folks, it could be any income level. I think something this simple would really improve the looks of our town.	Quality of Life Working Group	beautification

188450	Waterfront Park	The community of Vallejo is a diverse community that ranges of many races, culture, ethnicities, and ages. One main location that host all of these people would be the Vallejo Waterfront. Most adults go to the waterfront in order to enjoy the wind, sun, and scenery. These adults, that usually spend their days at the waterfront, are usually joggers, now Pokemon players, fishers, and daily commuters. More people would come to the waterfront if there is a new incentive.  There is a big area of land in the waterfront that is not being of use, except as open space. Yes, that space is beautiful for sailing kites. However, having one large area is enough. Since sailing kites in such a windy area is not usually successful. From what I remember of the waterfront, there are two large open spaces. One of those spaces, specially the more hilly area, could be the location of a new big park.   Just like the famous park in Benicia, with its gigantic slide, it attracts people of all ages. It becomes a place of multiple visits and a fantastic gathering area. By building a park in the waterfront, more children will be lured to become more physically active and enjoy their time outside with other children.  Also, not only that. With the coming out of Pokemon Go, people are attracted to the area due to the stops and gyms found there. If there was a park there, they would have another location to sit and enjoy their game.    By bringing in a park in the waterfront, it will increase the businesses around that area. Since more people are coming down to the waterfront, it would become a more popular place to gather groups of people. The park would act as an advertisement and incentive to come to the beautiful waterfront of Vallejo City. 	Quality of Life Working Group	tourism				
189833	Waterfront Skate/BMX/Scooter Park	The current waterfront plans don't appear to include anything geared towards the youth. Concrete skate parks provide the best ROI (return on investment) for the cities that build them. They are extremely low maintenance, provide a safe space for healthy activities, and when built to the proper scale they become a destination for end users from all over the region. The new park in Napa is an excellent example of this. Vallejo could do one better by placing it at the waterfront & thereby putting the park in an area easily accessible by many forms of transportation. It would also be closer to businesses which will benefit from added traffic by not only the users of the park, but also by those (such as parents) that may transport or accompany users of the park.
