It could be set up in a shed or portable building to start, with a list of essential tools and how to books and videos available to library card holders, with a part time staffer or volunteer to start. Vallejo is a working class town, with many low income home owners and homes being rented. Specifically, as a renter, you might want to maintain your rented home or yard, but not want to invest in heavy tools or machinery that might not fit into future homes. Low income home owners might have the desire to fix things themselves, but be lacking funds, knowlege or the ability to rent or invest in the tools needed. A tool library provides easy access to tools and knowledge for people who would otherwise be unable to access them, as well as for people who want to complete small projects one time or on a regular basis.Examples of tool libraries exist in Berkeley and Oakland and are well loved and well used by the residents there. The Berkeley tool library was started with a Community Block Grant in 1979, and was originallyfunded via small fees for tools, until in 1988 Berkeley passed a property based library tax, which allowed for the tool library to be included in the library budget.Push mowers, electric wheed whackers, post hole diggers,extension cords, hedge trimmers, ladders, cement mixers, hand trucks and dollies, plumbing tools, pipe threaders, circular saws, sanders, table saws, drills, and wheelbarrows are among Berkeley\'s listed most popular tools for check out. I myself borrowed circular saws, extension cords, and yard maintenance equipment as a renter in Berkeley to maintain the home we lived in. As a moderate income new homeowner, it would be amazing to have access to a similar resource here in Vallejo.'},
            {x: 0.299, y: -0.568, r: 5, label: 'Rails to Trails path From the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy: \'Rail-trails are multi-purpose public paths created from former railroad corridors. They are most often flat or follow a gentle grade as they traverse urban, suburban and rural communities in America. Ideal for many uses, such as walking, bicycling, inline skating, and equestrian and wheelchair use, rail-trails are extremely popular for both transportation and recreation. Trails add value to our lives in so many waysincreasing our mobility, improving our health, spurring economic development and job creation, protecting our environment and creating powerful connections within, to and across communities.RTC has identified more than 1,900 rail-trails, with at least one in every state. An additional 700+ are in the works, with new projects beginning each month. The economic effects of trails and greenways are sometimes readily apparent (as in the case of trailside businesses) and are sometimes more subtle, like when a company decides to move to a particular community because of amenities like trails. There is no question, however, that countless communities across America have experienced an economic revitalization due in whole or in part to trails and greenways. Trails and greenways create healthy recreation and transportation opportunities by providing people of all ages with attractive, safe, accessible and low- or no-cost places to cycle, walk, hike, jog or skate. Trails help people of all ages incorporate exercise into their daily routines by connecting them with places they want or need to go. Communities that encourage physical activity by making use of the linear corridors can see a significant effect on public health and wellness.In addition to providing a safe place for people to enjoy recreational activities, greenways and trails often function as viable transportation corridors. Trails can be a crucial element to a seamless urban or regional multi-modal transportation system. Many areas of the country incorporate trails and similar facilities into their transit plans, relying upon trail facilities to \'feed\' people in to and out of transit stations in a safe and efficient manner. The ability to avoid congested streets and highways, and travel through natural areas on foot or by non-motorized means, is a large factor in a community\'s \'livability.\'Many community leaders have been surprised at how trails have become sources of community identity and pride. These effects are magnified when communities use trails and greenways to highlight and provide access to historic and cultural resources. Many trails and greenways themselves preserve historically significant transportation corridors.\'Vallejo has an excellent opportunity to utilize its unused railways in a way that will benefit all the residents of the town and increase economic opportunity.'},

This project represents an opportunity to build resiliency in Vallejo youth and address long-term physical and mental health outcomes in a cost-effective manner. By training students to manage stress and to strengthen their social skills and self-awareness, we ensure a significant number of our youth are protected from negative outcomes such as substance abuse and depression. An investment of $1.00 in out of school time programming reaps a benefit of $11 to the community over time. With these self-management skills, Vallejo youth can live vibrant, productive lives now and into adulthood.  Who Benefits: Approximately 480 Vallejo youth will directly benefit from this project. This investment will impact students academic and social-emotional health by giving youth skills to enhance wellness into adulthood.  Location: After school at Vallejo City Unified Schools'},

But there are other benefits you may not have considered. Botanical gardensvary widely in design and purpose, but most are typically associated with environmental conservation, education, or historical interpretation. Yet, studies have shown thatbotanical gardenvisitors are often motivated by recreational and leisure interests. TheRole of Botanic Gardensin PlantConservation. ... Horticulture and cultivation skills allow us to grow plants that might be lost in nature, which means that species diversity can be conserved in thegardens, but also allows us to consider restoration and rehabilitation of degraded habitats. Botanic gardensare uniquely positioned to help address the issues relevant to restoring ecosystems. They provide knowledge and expertise in plant taxonomy, horticulture, biodiversity inventory, conservation biology, restoration ecology and ethnobotany  all key elements for achieving successful restoration. Here are few great reasons to build public botanical garden: PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT  Public gardens are good for the environment in multiple ways. They conserve endangered plant species through living collections as well as through seed banks, and they benefit pollinators like butterflies, honeybees, bats, and birds, which play an important role in the production of our crops and maintaining the health of other plant life. Plus, green spaces help filter pollutants in the air, lower temperatures (especially in urban areas), and protect waterways from contaminated runoff. By supporting public gardens, youre doing Mother Nature a favor. TAKE IN SOME CULTURE  In addition to their flowering exhibits, botanical gardens frequently offer cultural events like musical performances or art exhibits. GET ACTIVE  Dont let their soothing atmosphere fool you; gardens are a great place to get your heart rate up. Jog or stroll through the paths and trails, or take advantage of the exercise classes on offer at some gardens, like yoga, tai chi, pilates, or swing dancing. In some cities you can even find bootcamp style fitness classes in botanical garden settings. To get the whole family involved, check out the gardens calendar of events to search for kid friendly events, like scavenger hunts. PROMOTE YOURMENTAL HEALTH  Numerous studies have shown that being outdoors is good for our mental health, memory, and attention. A 2015 study by researchers at Stanford University, for example, found that a 90-minute walk in a natural setting (as compared to walking in an urban area) reduced activity in an area of the brain linked to depression and mental illness. Similarly, a 2014 University of Michigan study found that group nature walks were linked to better moods, even after a stressful event like divorce or losing a job.'},

The Missing Pieces  Now this is all theory, based of my own person experience and have had made, expensive bad decisions and trial and error.

The entrepreneurial projects and political initiatives are always changing, based on the interested applicants.

This way, when they do go public, the success rate and likelihood of their business/organization/initiative staying open and be self-sustainable, for the minimum of one year, is much greater, than if they had gone into the experience, without community support and the constant gaining of peer knowledge and team project collaboration.

My children go to Joseph Wardlaw Elementary. Although our home school has demonstrated great academic performance, many children still struggle in reading, science, and math. Vallejo Unified School District have been working hard on curbing behavior incidents in their campuses however, the issue of bullying and violence continues to affect many children. Many parents continue to worry about the well being of their children in school. Also at Wardlaw Elementary, parent involvement is also a problem. Last year, our PTA had some issues maintaining parent attendance in their monthly meetings. I believe that it is time that we invest our money to the future generation of our city. It is time that we reach out to all the families here in Vallejo and work collaboratively in making sure that all children are provided opportunities to become successful in school.   Here are some ideas on how we can help the children improve their tests scores, minimize behavior incidents, and promote parent involvement in schools.   Early Library Hours: Most students visit their school library once a week. However, there are instances they cannot go due to schedule conflict or lack of teacher supervision. For instance, my children have not gone to the library lately because their teacher is currently out on maternity leave and they do not have a permanent substitute teacher to take them to the library. We all know how important reading is to every child. I am suggesting that school library should open its doors by 7:30am so children can utilize its services before classes start. Although the school is discouraging parents from dropping off their children earlier than 8:15am, many children still come as early as 7:30am. Most parents have to be at work by 8:00am and may not have anyone help them to drop off their children. Behavior incidents have been reported to occur at this time due to lack of adult supervision. Teachers are not yet present to help supervise the children at this time. Also, not all parents can afford to send their children to before-school programs. Not to mention that working parents cannot change their working schedule to accommodate the suggested drop-off time. If we open the library by 7:30am, children can read books while waiting for the bell. They can also do their homework while they are in the library. If the children are preoccupied in the library, they are less likely to get into behavior problems. At Wardlaw, children who come in before 8:15am are asked to sit on the platform next to the cafeteria. They are not being productive at this time and more likely to get into conflicts with other children especially if there is no adult present to supervise them. By opening the library earlier, we can encourage children to read more and lessen the chances of getting into behavior problems. Multicultural Events at Schools: Vallejo is known to be a diverse community housing to many Filipinos, Hispanic, and African-American families in Northern California. For example, we can invite cultural performers to these festivals and have multicultural food serve for those who will attend. By having such events, families are likely to feel more welcomed and valued by their home schools. These events can encourage them to be more involved in their childrens schools. STEAM Laboratory: Many children have shown great interest in science, math, and technology. At Wardlaw, many students have actively participated in many STEAM activities and they also have a great relationship with their STEAM Coach, Mr. R. I am suggesting that we allot more funds for our STEAM Labs to have more materials and equipment in order for children to do more activities that promote STEAM. Mr. R always stay after school to help children with their science and technology projects and I wish other STEAM coaches would have the same resources to do so. Some schools may not even have a STEAM Coach that can help these children. It is also important that every school in Vallejo have a STEAM coach and a lab that children can readily access to in order to promote science, technology, engineering, art, and math. Many families here in Vallejo may not have access to such materials and equipment. The STEAM Lab maybe the only place they can access these materials. By having children be preoccupied with these activities, they are less likely to get into behavior problems. Also these activities can help increase their science and math scores. Having a full functioning STEAM Lab with a well-qualified coach can benefit many children and families here in Vallejo. '},

The entire City of Vallejo and its residents will benefit from this safety measure that will great ly reduce fire risks. Many of the homes in Vallejo are surrounded by overgrown dry brush covered hills. Goat herds are a natural way to clear this brush and have been used throughout the Bay Area in different cities and counties. It\'s environmentally friendly and is a fun way for our city to be more safe.http://www.goatsrus.com/is one site but I know there are more out there that could submit bids on this proposal.'}

            {x: 0.337, y: 0.405, r: 5, label: 'Remove Florida St Camphors and Repair Sidewalks For over thirty years, the mature camphor trees on Florida Street between Tuolemne and Amador Streets have not been maintained. The trees and root systems are huge, lifting sidewalks, curbs and gutters. When it rains, the gutter water does not drain effectively and often covers the sidewalk at Wolfe and Florida. Sidewalk sections are raised up in the air by tree roots. Roots tunnel under the sidewalks and lawns and extend all the way to the front of our homes; if one digs a little, one smells camphor roots near one\'s home. The roots effectively kill any home plantings by robbing those plants of water. Passersby avoid the raised sidewalk sections by walking out into the street and going around the raised areas. Personally, I do not like to see women with babies in strollers detour out into Florida Street to avoid the lifted sidewalks. That is unsafe behavior, particularly on busy Florida Street. It\'s a miracle no one has tripped and fallen on these raised sidewalks, breaking a hip or worse. The standing water is a health hazard, because mosquitoes lay their eggs in the standing water. Sometimes large trucks strike the trees overhanging Florida Street, and large limbs come crashing down; it is left to the homeowners to provide cleanup. The camphor trees are sufficiently large to interfere with overhead wires. Cosmetically, these trees are a mess, raining down leaves and berries during parts of the year, which certainly must block storm drains from time to time. To address these many issues, I believe the camphor trees should be removed. Sidewalks, curbs and gutters should be replaced. Smaller, more environmentally friendly trees should be planted to replace the camphors. The result would be a a more pleasing, attractive, healthier and safer look for Florida Street. No one should be at risk because of the camphor trees and the damage they have caused over the years.'},
            {x: 0.582, y: -0.079, r: 5, label: 'Parkway Tree Preservation City-wide, parkway tree maintenance hasbeen placed in the jurisdiction of the property owner for the last several years. While the city performed maintenance prior to the bankruptcy, an old ordinance was resuscitated to return responsibility for trees that homeowners did not plant back to the citizens. Many of our charming heritage neighborhoods, several of which were built as shipyard housing, have decades-old trees that have crushed cars, damaged homes and fences, and caused injuries. This project would pay public worksto maintainresidential area trees located in parkways of neighborhoods that were established before 1950.  Citizens have expressed concern about tree maintenance safety as well as expense, especially our senior citizens and the hundreds of uswho have yet to recover from the debilitating Great Recession. Trees planted at Admiral Farragut\'s and other city founders\' direction have crushed cars, damaged homes, blocked city streets, and occasionally caused personal injury to those living, parking, or walking near them. In addition, illegal dumpingregularly includes large amounts oftree trimmings because dump fees for green waste are no longer free. This project could create jobs for residents, reduce property damage and injury, and maintain the charm of our neighborhoods. Parkway Tree Preservationwould fund a three-person crew and a truck to establish a regularcycle of street tree maintenance to ensure that our city is aesthetically pleasing, that personal propery is protected, and that debris is removed appropriately. Neighborhoods built after 1950 would not be included as modern records are clear as to ownership of the trees. The trees planted after 2000 on 100 block of B Street, for example, would also be exempt since the CDBG-funded improvement project included input from property owners as to type of trees to be included. So-called \'heritage trees\' such as the deodora cedars on the 100 block of B Street, however, would fall into the PTP project as ownership cannot be determined as they were planted when Bay Terrace was still owned by the federal government. There are many other similarheritage neighborhoods on the west side of the city that would benefit from this project. NOTE: sidewalk repairs are also the responsibility of the property owner, but that sort of maintenance occurs very rarely while tree maintenance for most of the parkwaytrees must occur much more frequently to ensure the health of the tree and reduce damage to surrounding areas. As a result, this proposal only addresses the parkway trees.'},

Also on Indiana street at the corner of Napa, drivers whip around that corner speeding. There needs to be a stop sign there as well. I am particularly familiar with this area because I live here, but I am positive that other areas in Vallejo have similar speeding issues. Speeding is dangerous for the residents of the residential areas and for animal companions that are out on the streets as well. Thank you very much.   '},

ALL drivers and cyclists and pedestrians will benefit from this project. Local churchgoers, nearby businesses, workers and customers will benefit.  Why is this needed? We know that Sonoma Boulevard is one of the busiest streets in the city of Vallejo. The crossroads of Sonoma Boulevard and Ryder Street in particular are in great need of a crosswalk and stop sign installment, especially with records of numerous accidents reported in this area in the past. There are business located along these streets, and drivers turning into these streets face a serious danger as there is no stop sign to ensure the safety of all drivers traveling such a high speed. Pedestrians, including families with children and elderly people, face an even higher danger, as Sonoma Boulevard is a busy street which is dangerous to cross without a crosswalk, with vehicles travelling at such high speeds. In addition to safety, adding stop signs will allow businesses to gain more attention as more and more drivers will receive the opportunity to take that much more time to view what businesses line this street rather than driving right past them.'},
